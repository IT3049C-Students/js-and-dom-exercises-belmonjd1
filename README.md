## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
The videos in the module really helped me understand how JS and DOM can be used, which feels great considering that I dropped out of this class the last time I took it.

### How long it took you to finish this?
At least 5 hours and I was also held up by the fact that I had an issue with my cypress installation. That being said, I completed this lab immediately after that issue was resolved.
